Evaluation of Memory Allocation and Configuration Strategies Achieving Highest Memory Utilization and CPU Performance

 
Management of main memory is critical as an entire system performance are highly dependent on two aspects; how much memory is available and how the memory is optimized during job processing. The question is, how is one memory management strategy evaluated for a computing system? This is a comprehensive algorithm on dynamic partitioning of the main memory and how different placement strategies are evaluated in various performance metrics. Two memory placement algorithms are implemented, which are Best-fit memory allocation algorithm and First-fit memory allocation algorithm.
